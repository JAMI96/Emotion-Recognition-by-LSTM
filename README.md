## Speech Emotion Recognition
Speech Emotion Recognition Project aims to develop a system capable of automatically detecting emotions from speech signals. 
We start by collecting a dataset of speech samples labeled with corresponding emotions.
Preprocessing techniques are applied to clean and standarize the audio data. Feature extraction methods such as MFCCs are used to capture relevant informations from speech signals.
ML models, such as SVM or RNN, CNN are used. Here, I chose CNN to trained on the extracted features to classify emotions.
The model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy and F1 score to assess its peformance.
Finally, we deploy the trained model into real world application where it can accurately recognize emotion in speech in real time.
